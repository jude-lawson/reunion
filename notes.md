What was easy?
* Creating tests, and then writing code. This always helps me design my code.


What was difficult?
* Interpreting some of the more open-ended aspects of the spec, like 'evaluate Activity cose'. How is that evaluated? Is it added as part of the initial state of the and Activity object?
